### Cloud Pak on Open Shift Lab overview.

This lab is an introduction to Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA) in the context of OpenShft.<br/>

We start with high-level Cloud Pak architecture and how it integrates with Open Shift.<br/>

Next we study ICP4ACluster, custom resource for CP4BA mulitpattern operator. We focus on ways to manage complexity, query CR, and manage differences between environments with kustomize.<br/>

Next, we install CP4BA operator and discuss operator dependencies.<br/>

Next, we apply production kustomizations to ICP4A CR and start cloud pak install. This may take some time to complete.<br/>

Next, we study Foundational Services Operators and runtime on-demand operator dependency resolution.<br/>

We review Foundational Sevices impact on multi-tenancy cloud pak deployments.<br/>

After CP4BA is installed, we log into the Cloud Pak console for a brief review of Workflow Process Authoring environment. We review running pods and storage claims.

Next, we review workload isolation patterns and best practice for cloud pak deployment.<br/>
