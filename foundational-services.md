### Foundational Services.

*Cloud Pak for Business Automation* is multi-pattern cloud pak: workflow, content, document automation, process mining, etc.<br/>
Each capability requires *`iam`* and *`zen ui`* components. These are *core* services that provide consistent authentication and UI experience.<br/>

In addition, cloud pak capabilities require databases, event processors, search service, and business teams service.<br/>
If you review `patterns knowledge base`, you will find that all patterns depend on *`cloud pak foundational components`*.<br/>

Other cloud paks (*Cloud Pak for Integration*, *Cloud Pak for Data*, *Cloud Pak for AIOPS*), require *`foundational components`*.<br/>

`Core` foundational services must be deployed with every cloud pak operator deployment.<br/>
`Optional` foundational services are deployed only if they are selected for deployment either directly, or as a dependency by cloud pak capabilities.<br/>

`Core` foundational services:<br/>
```
- iam - Identity and Access Management
- zen UI - Integrated UI, includes identity and role management to control access to installed capabilities.
- licensing - Cloud Pak usage, *singleton*, only one instance of this operator in the cluster.
- certificate management - manage and store tls certificates, *singleton*, only one instance of this operator in the cluster.
- namespace scope - grant operator permissions in advanced topologies.
```

`Optional` foundational services:<br/>
```
- db2
- postgres
- kafka
- flink
- elastic search
- user data services
- business teams service
```

The reason is that some operator dependencies are resolved dynamically, at run time.<br/>

To support Cloud Pak requirements,`Foundational services operators` enable *runtime dependency resolution*, *versioning*, and *sharing* of `foundational services`.<br/>

#### Foundational sevices bootstrap.

Foundational services link to a cloud pak, `ibm-common-services` operator is a dependency of a cloud pak operator.<br/>
As we discussed earlier, when an operator is installed, dependent operators are always installed.<br/>

In turn, `ibm-common-services` operator depends on another operator, `operand-deployment-lifecycle-manager` operator, *ODLM*.<br/>

> Following dependency chain: `cloud-pak operator` -> `ibm-common-services-operator` -> `ODLM`.<br/>

An *operator* is acting on it's *operands*. CR is a trigger. When operator detects a change in CR, it will act on it's *operands* to reconsile state with CR requirements. To say it differently, CR reconciliation results in *operand* deployment.<br/>

For ODLM, an operand is another operator. To act, ODLM installs it's operand and then creates a CR for it, triggering reconciliation and operand deployment.<br/>

ODLM CR is called OperandRequest.<br/>
OperandRequest CR can trigger a group of ODLM operands. ODLM will manage them at the same time.<br/>

> Following event chain: OperandRequest CR -> ODLM -> install new operator(s) and create CR(s) -> trigger operand deployment for new operator(s).<br/>

ODLM manages *groups of operands*.<br/>

*ODLM* enables on-demand depedency resolution, and sharing of foundational services.<br/>

> *This is Key*:<br/>
`ODLM` installs new operators *on demand* and *automatically applies preconfigured CR*, triggering CR reconciliation and new operand deployment.<br/>
For shared foundational services, `ODLM` creates just one instance of a service operator, and one instance of a service.<br/>
In some cases, ODLM will just install it's operand without creating triggering CR.<br/>

#### ODLM on-demand dependecy resolution.

We review ODLM configuration CRs, and explain runtime dependency resolution.<br/>

To start, when cloud pak operator needs foundational services it creates OperandRequest CR with required services.<br/>

#### IBM Common Services Operator

There is one more important component supporting foundational services. It is `ibm-common-services` operator.<br/>
As mentioned before it is a link between foundational services and cloud pak operator.<br/>

`ibm-operational-services` creates CommonService CR common-service that plays important role in foundational services configuration and multi-tenancy.<br/>

    subscriptionStatus: Succeeded
    version: v1.18.5
```

To conclude, we review parameters in CommonService CR that support foundation services multi-tenancy and workload isolation.<br/>

It is possible to place 'OperandRegistry' and 'OperandConfig' CR's in different namespaces and affect placement of foundational services operators and foundational services in different namespaces to achieve workload isolation objectives. We will review examples of workload isolation topologies.<br/>

> Lab step.
Query CommonService common-service CR.<br/>

```
oc get CommonService common-service -o yaml | yq -y '.spec'

license:
  accept: true
operatorNamespace: cp4ba
servicesNamespace: cp4ba
size: starterset
storageClass: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
```

#### Workload isolation topologies.

By default, cloud pak operator is installed in 'one namespace' mode with foundational services in the same namespace.<br/>

This topology enables maximum isolation between cloud pak deployments. Each cloud pak deployment can be upgraded independently.<br/>

Another topology is to install foundational services in one namespace and cloud pak operators in another namespace.<br/>
In this case foundational services can be shared by a tenant. Foundational service operators must be given access to tenant namespaces.

Another topology is to place operators in one namespace and create operands in another namespace.<br/>
This approach is taken by Cloud Pak for Data.

If cloud pak operator is installed in 'all-namespaces' mode, then foundational services operators must be installed in 'all namespaces` mode.<br/>
If one cloud pak operator is installed in 'all-namespaces' mode, then all other cloud pak operators must be installed in `all-namespaces` mode.

It is recommended that cloud paks are installed in isolated namespaces and not share foundational services.

### Cloud Pak Cluster Topology Considerations

> IBM recommends, that Cloud Pak namespaces be labeled and assigned to machine sets. Machine set must have 3 or more nodes<br/>
> Private topology is prefred to isolate all services by tenant (namespace). IBM recommends that each cloud pak instance is installed with it's own dedicated foundational services.<br/>
> Cloud Paks can be deployed to Machine Sets (grouping of worker nodes that scale up and down) to provide workload isolation for worker nodes. For clusters with in Cloud Availability Zones, worker nodes should be placed accross all zones.<br/>
