## Workflow Process Service Authoring pattern.

IBM CP4BA Workflow Process Service is a small-footprint business automation environment<br/>
to develop, test, and run workflow processes that orchestrate human tasks and services.<br/>
It provides single runtime container.<br/>

Workflow Process Service is offered only as part of Cloud Pak for Business Automation.<br/>

Workflow Process Service Authoring pattern is authoring environment for WPS.<br/>
Workflow Process Service Authoring pattern is deployed by CP4BA multi-pattern operator.<br/>

Let's look at operator operands.<br/>

Operand can be any type of object created by an operator in response to CR: Deployment, Stateful Set, etc.

Operand Stateful Sets:<br/>
```
oc get StatefulSets

```

How to find environment variable names in Stateful Set?<br/>
```
oc get statefulset icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment -o yaml | yq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[].name'
```

`icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment` StatefulSet is Business Automation Studio and internal Business Automation and JMS Runtime.<br/>
```
oc get statefulset icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment -o yaml | yq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[] | select(.name=="is_internal_baw")'
{
  "name": "is_internal_baw",
  "value": "true"
}
```

```
oc get statefulset icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment -o yaml | yq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[] | select(.name=="JMS_SERVER_HOST")'
{
  "name": "JMS_SERVER_HOST",
  "value": "icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment-0.icp4adeploy-bastudio-service-headless.cp4ba1.svc"
}
```

There is one pod in this stateful set.<br/>
```
oc get pods | grep -i run | grep -v oper | grep icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment

icp4adeploy-bastudio-deployment-0                                1/1     Running     0               7h8m
```

Workflow Process Authoring database pod is owned by Edb Postgres Cluster Custom Resource.<br/>
```
oc get pods icp4adeploy-wps-db-1 -o yaml | yq '.metadata.ownerReferences'
[
  {
    "apiVersion": "postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1",
    "blockOwnerDeletion": true,

    "uid": "52e9db55-1c91-4c56-a8bc-0f4063ad1767"
  }

```

```
oc get cluster

zen-metastore-edb    7h58m   1           1       Cluster in healthy state   zen-metastore-edb-1
```

You can see that operator manages database cluster.<br/>

Edb Postgres Operator Cluster CR is owned by ICP4ACluster CR.<br/>
```
oc get cluster icp4adeploy-wps-db  -o yaml | yq '.metadata.ownerReferences'

It is easy to correlate operator pods with operator subscriptions.<br/>

Query operand pods.<br/>
Note that not every operator deployed an operand.<br/>
As we discussed in module 2 static operator dependencies are always deployed.<br/>
Deployed CR's depend on the use case.<br/>
